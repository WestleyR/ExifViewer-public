This is the release description for PhotoMD V1.1.0

View and edit image EXIF and other metadata of an image.

Supported images:

 - JPG/JPEG: Full support
 - PNG: Full support
 - TIFF: Full support
 - HEIC: Mostly supported*
 - GIF: Read only
 - NEF: Read only
 - RW2: Read only
 - Other RAW or compressed images: Read only

*Lacks the ability to remove all metadata.
Full support = read and write to metadata.

Before using this app, beware of some of the known issues:

 - Can't erase all metadata from HEIC images
 - No video support
 - Can't edit RAW images
 - Erasing a metadata key with a INT value will not remove the tag, only zeros it
 - Sometimes can't add "SerialNumber" tags to image
 - Can't edit arrays, like: "JFIFVersion", "ComponentsConfiguration", "ISOSpeedRatings", or "FlashPixVersion"
 - Image will always be re-compressed when editing the metadata

Despite of those issues (witch may be fixed in an upcoming update), PhotoMD is an okay alternative to "exiftool" (command-line) for people that like a GUI.
