View and edit image EXIF and metadata.

Supported image formats:

 - JPG/JPEG: Full support
 - PNG: Full support
 - TIFF: Full support
 - HEIC: Mostly supported*
 - GIF: Read only
 - NEF: Read only
 - RW2: Read only
 - Other RAW or compressed images: read only

  Full support = read and write to metadata.
* Lacks the ability to "Delete all data".

PhotoMD has some limitations; before using this app, please note the following known issues:

 - "Erase all data" button will not work on HEIC images
 - Can't edit RAW images**
 - Erasing metadata key with a INT value will not remove the tag, only zeros it**
 - Can't edit arrays, like: "JFIFVersion", "ComponentsConfiguration", "ISOSpeedRatings", or "FlashPixVersion"**
 - Image will always be recompressed when editing the metadata
 - Sometimes tag keys with Serial Numbers cannot be added
 - Sometimes tag keys with Lens Models cannot be added
 - Not all metadata is editable
 - Sometimes an image tag (metadata key) will fail to add without warning (mostly applies to HEIC images)

** Expected to be fixed in an upcoming update.
