## View and edit image EXIF and metadata

PhotoMD allows you to view, and edit your image metadata, including EXIF, TIFF, IPTC, and more.

Supported image formats:

 - JPG/JPEG: Full support
 - PNG: Full support
 - TIFF: Full support
 - HEIC: Mostly supported₁
 - GIF: Read only
 - NEF: Read only
 - RW2: Read only
 - Other RAW or compressed images: read only

 Full support = read and write to metadata.

## Easily sort your images

PhotoMS's interface is designed to help you keep your images sorted, only keeping the best ones, and deleting the "less good" photos₂.


Disclamers:

PhotoMD has some limitations; before using this app, please note the following known issues:

 - "Erase all data" button will not work on HEIC images
 - Can't edit RAW images₃
 - Erasing metadata key with a INT value will not remove the tag, only zeros it₃
 - Can't edit arrays, like: "JFIFVersion", "ComponentsConfiguration", "ISOSpeedRatings", or "FlashPixVersion"₃
 - Image will always be recompressed when editing the metadata
 - If editing an image thats less then 1kb, the image will likely gain in size
 - Sometimes tag keys with Serial Numbers cannot be added
 - Sometimes tag keys with Lens Models cannot be added
 - Not all metadata is editable
 - Sometimes an image tag (metadata key) will fail to add without warning (mostly applies to HEIC images)
 - Removing all image data does not remove “ProfileName”₃

Footnotes:

 ₁. lacks the ability to "Delete all data".
 ₂. photos deleted from PhotoMD are moved to your trash.
 ₃. expected to be fixed in an upcoming update.
